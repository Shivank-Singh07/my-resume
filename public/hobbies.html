            <h3>Programming:</h3>
            <p>One of the most fun activities I like to do in my leisure time is programming. I like to make different games. I get a satisfaction on playing my own games. Till the date, I've made many games using Python. My most favourite game amongst those I've made is the addictive dinosaur game inspired by the <a href="https://chromedino.com/">Google Dino Game</a>.</p>

        <li>
            <h3>Musical Instruments:</h3>
            <p>My another hobby is playing musical instruments like piano. I like to play various songs and tunes on piano. The songs that I play on piano can change my mood. For example, if I am angry and I play a happy or sad song, then my mood changes accordingly.</p>

            <h3>Playing Cricket:</h3>
            <p>My favourite sport is cricket. It's one of my greatest passions. I play cricket everyday in the evening with my friends. I am a right handed batting all-rounder. My favourite cricket player is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a>.</p>
